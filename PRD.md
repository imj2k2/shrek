## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# AI-driven Multi-Agent Algorithmic Trading Platform

### 1. Overview
This platform leverages AI-powered, multi-agent architecture for automated trading across stocks, options, and cryptocurrencies. It integrates with Alpaca and Robinhood via Lumibot, employs a Gradio-based UI for portfolio visualization, uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for multi-agent coordination, and provides notifications and insights via Discord.
